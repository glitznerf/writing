# Writing
Writing often helps collecting the many ideas and thoughts floating around when thinking deeply about something. Most end up on some piece of paper or notebook and are forgotten forever, but some that might prove interesting or even [useful] (http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html) end up here!
