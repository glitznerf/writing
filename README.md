# Writing
Writing often helps collecting the many ideas and thoughts floating around when thinking deeply about something. Most end up on some piece of paper or notebook and are forgotten forever, but some that might prove interesting or even [useful](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html) end up here!

## Reach Out
I am always looking for feedback as well as reading recommendations regarding topics I write about and ideas for related topics, so please [reach out](mailto:glitznerf@gmail.com)!

## Inventory
- [Modern Intelligence](https://github.com/glitznerf/writing/blob/main/modern_intelligence.md): An exploration of the fascinating topic of intelligence and some thoughts on the impact of technology on intelligence, collective intelligence, distributed intelligent systems, brain-computer interfaces and the future of human intelligence.

## NOTE
Most of these writings are sketches or **DRAFTS** and not fully edited manuscripts. Through version control, GitHub seems to be a suitable place to publish ideas even if they are not fully polished yet. Please read out of curiosity and leisure, but do not quote or copy or use otherwise without request.
